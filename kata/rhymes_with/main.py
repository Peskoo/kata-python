"""
Generate all the possible rhyming words given an example.

A word rhymes if it has the same vowel plus consonants, but different beginning.

Some examples:

cat rhymes with hat
tear rhymes with bear

Nonsense words are fine, e.g.

torrie rhymes with zorrie

Schematically, a rhyme is something like this:
[something][vowels][consonants]

vowels = "aeiou"
consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"

This won't work perfectly without an english dictionary and phonetic representation. Do as well as can be done with a
dozen or two lines of code.
