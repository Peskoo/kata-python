Create a text adventure map with three rooms.

Navigation is done with N, S, E, W.

Describe rooms on entry.

Prevent attempting to leave a room by an impossible route.

There are many ways to implement this. A way that makes it easy to completely swap out a new map without
changing all lines of code is a superior solution.
