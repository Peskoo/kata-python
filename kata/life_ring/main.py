"""
Life ring game or Searching a list of bits for the on bit.

An ocean x units wide has a man overboard, drawn with a Y.

You must throw a life ring to resuce them, by guessing their coordinate. The diagram is drawn on screen, so
the user only needs to guestimate how much white space they see.

A shark (or sharks) is swimming on the grid according to some sort of search pattern. You have to find the
swimmer before the shark does.

Each shark can either do a scan, binary search, random search. The shark can remember what it did previously
and gets clues from the environment, such as "too high/too low", "found/not found", the bounds of the ocean,
"warmer/colder", i.e. warmer if closer to the swimmer. A good shark finds the swimmer the fastest with the fewest
clues.
