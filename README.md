# kata-python
Kata is Japanese for form, as in patterns for practice. You practice the same pattern over and over until you're better at coding. Coding kata are short programs 
you can write over and over.

Most of these are inspired by an ancient book [BASIC is Fun](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Fun-Computer-Problems-Children/dp/0380806061), which was a bunch of programs you could type and run on an 8 bit machine and as a by product maybe learn to write code. In retrospect, this was pretty crazy, since most of these are about as difficult as fizz-buzz, [which as we know some people can't solve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). I've been wanting to translate the code into a modern programing language since forever. Most of the problems were algebra story problems. The solved section isn't a translation of the original, coding styles are so radically different little would be salvagable from the original.

These questions are far easier than [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JV9XCVQ6A174G137R2W2).

If use in an interview, or as a "homework question", in my opinion, the demonstrate:

1. Speed. Can you solve it quickly.
2. Converation starts. Now that we have some real code, we got somethign we can talk about.
3. Aptitude. If you can solve a simple question, no one knows if you are a good programmer. If you can't solve
4. Proxy for a portfolio. Developers best code is probably locked behind non-disclosure agreements of various sorts and even if it wasn't, it sometimes so domain specific, large and mixed with other developers work that it is hard for an intervier to see what is going on.
